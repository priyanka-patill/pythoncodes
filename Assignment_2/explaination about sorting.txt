Here's what it does:

students: This is the original list of dictionaries, 
where each dictionary contains information about a student,
 including their name, grade, and attendance.

sorted() function: This built-in Python function returns a 
new sorted list from the elements of any iterable
 (in this case, the students list). 
It does not modify the original list.

key=lambda x: x["Grade"]: This part specifies the sorting criteria. 
Let's break it down further:

lambda x: x["Grade"]: This is a lambda function (an anonymous function) that takes one argument x and returns x["Grade"]. In this context, x represents each dictionary in the students list. So, the lambda function extracts the "Grade" value from each dictionary.

key=: The key parameter of the sorted() function tells it to 
use the provided lambda function to extract the value for 
comparison during sorting.

In summary, the sorted() function uses the lambda function to extract 
the "Grade" value from each dictionary in the students list and sorts 
the dictionaries based on these values. The result is a new list,
 sorted_students, where the student dictionaries are ordered by 
their grades in ascending order.
